# Overview

This is the initial capstone project submitted to fulfill the requirements of the UC Berkeley Professional Certificate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

The research problem is: “Can we predict whether an EV charging session represents a Casual Driver, Commuter, or Long-Distance Traveler based on charging and driving behaviors, and how can these insights support better charging infrastructure planning and personalized EV services?”

As an initial report, the emphasis is on the technical process of building and evaluating predictive models. Broader business insights and non-technical discussions will be expanded in the Final Report.
